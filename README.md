# Daily Problem Solving on GeeksforGeeks 🚀

Hi there! 👋 I'm **Varshith**, and this repository is my journey to consistency in problem-solving. My goal is to solve at least **one problem a day** on [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and upload my solutions here.

## Why This Repository? 🤔
1. **Consistency**: Developing a habit of solving problems daily.
2. **Growth**: Improving my problem-solving skills and deepening my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
3. **Accountability**: Keeping track of my progress and staying committed.

## Structure 📂
Each solution is organized by:
- **Topic**: Categorized by the subject (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Graphs, etc.).
- **Date**: Every solution is tagged with the date I solved it.

## How to Navigate 🧭
1. Browse through the directories to find problems by topic or date.
2. Each folder contains:
   - The problem statement (if applicable).
   - My solution code.
   - Comments explaining the approach.

## Follow My Journey ✨
I believe in progress, no matter how small. If you'd like to follow along or solve problems together, feel free to:
- ⭐ Star this repository!
- Fork it and start your own daily challenge!

Happy coding! 💻🎉  
\- **Varshith**
